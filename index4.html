            <p class="lg:w-1/2 w-full leading-relaxed text-gray-500">How we met :  One day while giving a speaking test in Didar Sir's class, I suddenly saw Munirah speaking smoothly and confidently in front of the camera for the first time. And yes, I keep swallowing the words! I kept thinking that if I could talk like this! After that, I send friend requests to Munirah like all other classmates. After that Eid came, so I send Eid Mubarak to everyone including Munirah. But there is no replay. Then a few days later our final came and 3 days before the presentation of the final Munirah suddenly gave me a message. And said you are the only person I haven't introduced yet. So the first time I heard it and I didn't reply to the message. Later Munirah gives a message again! I was listening to music. After a while, I gave a replay. At the beginning of the conversation, She offered to make me a brother, but I said why can't we be friends? Surprisingly, Munirah easily agreed. After that, it felt very good to talk to her. We started to be a little better friends. After that, sometimes I was a little angry with her. But I fix the problems immediately. It goes on like this. Then suddenly one day Munirah tells me to be her best friend. I am very happy and surprised. Because I have never had a female best friend before! So I do my best to keep this friendship going. After that our understanding started to get better. Then slowly Munirah started trusting me, started sharing her feelings. And on January 4, 2021, I spoke to Munirah on the first phone. And this is my first time talking to a girl for so long. Now Munirah understands me better than she and I understand her better than me. And finally, I just want to let you know that no matter what happens your Rakib is always there for you. No matter how bad the situation is I will always there for you for the rest of my life.</p>
