            <p class="lg:w-1/2 w-full leading-relaxed text-gray-500">First of all, Munirah enjoys making friends. Her chill and friendly attitude make others attracted to her. She is just too kind that I can't even describe. She loves her family very much. Specially her father is a good friend of her. Then there is a cute little one called Aysha. Munirah loves to play with her. Munirah loves talking and she is a good listener. Munirah loves to listen songs. Specially nightcore songs are awesome. She loves to be happy and make others happy too. She enjoy go outside with her brother abrar. And one other thing she loves her hijab too much. If you messed up her hijab she will be pretty mad I guess. She loves to give others nicknames. She loves to listen compliments about her.</p>
